# "Perhaps I do like horrors?": Towards understanding user's change in preference through embeddings.

This is our implementation for the paper:
"Perhaps I do like horrors?": Towards understanding user's change in preference through embeddings.

This paper study how we can use the information in the items' embeddings to break the filter-bubble. 
To showcase our framework, we used the Movielens dataset and present an offline analysis that illustrate that, based on the distance between movies of different genres, 
we are able to recommend movies from a given target genre such that the amount of movies of such target genre that the user continues to watch is maximized.
